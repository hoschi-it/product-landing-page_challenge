        <h2>Who are rubber ducks?</h2>
        <p>Well, this question is not that simple to answer. Some of them are
          nice, some don't like company. Some are silly, some are grown up or
          just boring.</p>
        <p>Though people tend to judge them, there is not much they have in
          common:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Most of them</em> have yellow coat.</li>
          <li>They have a beak.</li>
          <li>They hush, unless they are put under pressure.</li>
          <li>They can swim on water.</li>
          <li>They are very patient.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>So what is all this "every rubber duck is the same"? It is simply not
          true.</p>
